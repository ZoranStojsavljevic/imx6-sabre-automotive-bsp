## imx6 Sabre automotive evaluation board setup

http://events17.linuxfoundation.org/sites/events/files/slides/AGLAMM_How%20we%20Run%20AGL%20on%20i.MX%20processors_tkobayashi_25FEB16%20rev.D.pdf

## Get u-boot

The latest u-boot version might not work out of the box.

    git clone http://git.denx.de/u-boot.git u-boot-i.mx6 OR
    git clone git://git.denx.de/u-boot.git u-boot-i.mx6
    cd u-boot-i.mx6

The cloned version will comply with HEAD set to master branch (the following command is optional):

    git checkout -b <branch-name> # Take the current HEAD (the commit checked
    # out) and create a new branch called <branch-name>

## Installing arm cross compiler on the host (the host used is Fedora 30 distro)

To install on Fedora 30 gcc-arm-linux-gnu.x86_64 (which is not native x86_64 compiler), the following command is used:

    sudo dnf install gcc-arm-linux-gnu.x86_64

To install on Debian Stretch or Buster, the following command is used:

    sudo apt-get install gcc-arm-linux-gnueabihf

## u-boot Build

Build u-boot using an ARM cross compiler, e.g. Fedora 30 gcc-arm-linux-gnu.x86_64:

To make .config file, the following command is required:

    Fedora:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnu- make -j8 mx6sabreauto_defconfig

    Debian:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make -j8 mx6sabreauto_defconfig

## Actual u-boot compilation:

    Fedora:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnu- make -j8

    Debian:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make -j8

## Place SPL and u-boot.img OR u-boot.imx on SD card

For the Sabre board case, u-boot.imx will not be generated as this board supports SPL. Two files are generated: SPL and u-boot.img.

In order to flash the SD card!

SPL should reside at offset 1024KB (1MB) of the SD card. To place it there:

    $ sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/sdb bs=1k seek=1; sync
    (Note - the SD card node may vary, so adjust this as needed).

    Flash the u-boot.img image into the SD card:
    $ sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/sdb bs=1k seek=69; sync

For the U-boot.imx case, it should reside at offset 1024KB (1MB) of the SD card. To place it there:

    $ dd if=u-boot.imx of=/dev/<your-sd-card> bs=1k seek=1; sync

The SD card device is typically something as /dev/sd<X> or /dev/mmcblk<X>. Note that there is a need for write permissions on the SD card for the command to succeed, so there is a need to su - as root, or use sudo, or do a chmod a+w as root on the SD card device node to grant permissions to users.

## Partitioning SD card

Here, two parttion are create: /dev/sdX1 for kernel, and /dev/sdX2 for rootfs.

Given example where /dev/sdX is /dev/sdb :

    echo "Create primary partition 1 for kernel"
    echo -e "n\np\n1\n\n+256M\nw\n"  | fdisk /dev/sdb

    echo "Create primary partition 2 for rootfs"
    echo -e "n\np\n2\n\n+8192M\nw\n"  | fdisk /dev/sdb

    echo "Formatting primary partition sdb1 for kernel"
    mkfs.vfat -F 32 /dev/sdb1

    echo "Formatting primary partition sdb2 for rootfs"
    mkfs.ext4 -F /dev/sdb2

## Making kernel using kernel.org vanilla (the latest stable upon writing this document) kernel 5.2.8

The kernel 5.2.8 source code is located @ the following location:

https://mirrors.edge.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/

The file to be downloaded is the following: linux-5.2.8.tar.xz

The command to unpack the designated kernel is:

    tar -xvf inux-5.2.8.tar.xz
    cd linux-5.2.8/

To build the kernel, the following should be done:

Make proper .config:

    Fedora:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnu- make -j8 imx_v6_v7_defconfig

    Debian:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make -j8 imx_v6_v7_defconfig

Compile the kernel itself:

    Fedora:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnu- make -j8

    Debian:
    ARCH=arm CROSS_COMPILE=arm-linux-gnueabihf- make -j8

The kernel itself to be used is in the directory: .../linux-5.2.8/arch/arm/boot/ and it is called zImage:

    .../linux-5.2.8/arch/arm/boot/zImage

The .dtb file to be used is in the directory: .../linux-5.2.8/arch/arm/boot/dts/ and it is called imx6q-sabreauto.dtb

    .../linux-5.2.8/arch/arm/boot/dts/imx6q-sabreauto.dtb

The location on SD card both components should be placed is /dev/sdX1 mounted to some directory (example: /tmp/sdX1 (where the SD card itself is: /dev/sdX).

Assuming X=b, it looks like:

    mount /dev/sdb1 /tmp/sdb1

The following will happed after booting u-boot, and after booting kernel 5.2.8 from the SD card (initial boot @ [  0.000000]):

## Making rootfs (using latest up to date YOCTO thud distribution):

http://variwiki.com/index.php?title=Yocto_Build_Release&release=RELEASE_MORTY_V1

## Specific annexes/addendums to the YOCTO documentation above:

The tags are also listed in https://github.com/varigit/variscite-bsp-platform/tags

To specify a latest release/tag (up to date), the following should be issued:

    repo init -u https://github.com/varigit/variscite-bsp-platform.git -b refs/tags/thud-fslc-4.14.78-mx6ul-v1.1

To understand how to setup the environment, the following command should be issued:

    source setup-environment

After evaluating the documentation, the following is done to setup the proper environment:

    MACHINE=imx6qdlsabreauto DISTRO=fslc-x11 source setup-environment build
